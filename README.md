## Project Description
***

##### Overview:
Module 4 project for Flatiron school. I attempted to make an Amazon website clone. Since i only had week to work on this initially I mainly got the functionality and basic styling done.

[Frontend](https://github.com/RobertTTaylor9517/mod4-Shoply-frontend)

##### Challenges:
My main challenge was figuring out exactly what serializer to use to only get all the information I needed, so i could keep my fetch request count to a minimum.


## Getting Started
***
1. Clone this repo.
2. Open it in a terminal or your favorite IDE
3. Create the database with `rails db:create`
4. Then seed the data with `rails db:seed`
5. Run `bundle install` to install all neccessary gems
6. Add a .env file and make sure to define ENV['KEY']
7. Start backend with `rails s`, preferably on port 3000
